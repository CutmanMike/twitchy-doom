# SpawnItem

Spawns an item in the world, outside of the Player's line of sight. The username of the person who sent the command will appear above it as long as it is in the players's line of sight.

## Parameters
```
Actor - The actor to give to the player.
Distance - The minimum distance away from the player (in 128 map units) in order for the Actor to spawn. Default is 1.
Distance=Random - Use a random distance.
Effect - The effect actor to spawn when the Actor is spawned. Default is TeleportFog.
NoLOS - Spawn the actor even if a player is in line of sight.
```

`Actor` should be a valid Actor class. If the class is a RandomSpawner, it will choose an actor from the result of that RandomSpawner.

`Distance` changes how far away the actor must be from a player in order to spawn. The value is multiplied by 128 map units. If you specify a value of 3, it will try to spawn the actor at least 384 map units away. If it cannot find a safe location at this distance it will try one closer to the player. Specifying Random will pick a random value between 1 and 50.

## Examples

```
$savetofile("C:\MyFiles\Stream\STREAM.txt","SpawnItem|Actor=RocketBox|$username|$dummyormsg")
```
Spawns a box of rockets near the player for them to pick up.

```
$savetofile("C:\MyFiles\Stream\STREAM.txt","GiveItem|Actor=ExplosiveBarrel,NoName=true|$username|$dummyormsg")
```
Spawns an Explosive Barrel near the player, and doesn't show the username above the actor.
